# Megan is to be Seen and Not Heard!

This repo provides replacement sounds.ini files for Earth & Beyond which
reduce the volume of Megan, your personal digital assistant, or even mute her
entirely.

## Install

Select which option you want and go to the corresponding directory:

    half_volume/
    mute/

Then copy the `sounds.ini` from that directory to your game install, e.g.

    C:\Program Files (x86)\EA GAMES\Earth & Beyond\Data\client\ini\sounds.ini

Note that you may have to repeat this after updates which could overwrite this
file.

## Uninstall

You can either make a backup copy of your existing `sounds.ini` (best) or use
the one provided in this repo under:

    original/

Simply overwrite the modified `sounds.ini` above with your backup or the
original from here.
